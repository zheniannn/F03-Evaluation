# Relocated Wide-Area Weak-Target Experiment Audit

- Truth: `/home/tzhen/projects/PLSWORK/F03-Evaluation/data/active/radar_truth_relocated`
- Detections: `/home/tzhen/projects/PLSWORK/F03-Evaluation/data/active/sim_detections_relocated`
- Coverage range audited against: **100 km**

## Interpretation

This is a **wide-area** weak-target experiment, not a range-contained
radar-coverage experiment:

- Relocation anchors each trajectory's **start** near the radar (first
  sample in the 10-80 km anchor band); after that first sample the
  aircraft follows its original ADS-B-derived motion unchanged, so the
  **full trajectories are retained** and long flights drift well beyond
  the anchor band.
- Stage 6's `--max-range-m 100000` defines the spatial
  **clutter support** only -- where false alarms are generated. It does
  **not** remove target truth rows beyond 100 km.
- Targets beyond 100 km stay in the dataset and simply become
  weaker: the range-decay SNR model hands them progressively lower SNR
  and therefore lower detection probability.
- This setup is suited to studying threshold trade-offs and weak-target
  tracking over long trajectories. A future range-contained experiment
  would need stage-5 post-relocation target filtering or a stage-6
  target-range gate.

## Coverage-range audit

How much of the experiment lives beyond the 100 km clutter-support
radius (retained by design, at reduced SNR):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Fraction of truth rows beyond 100 km | 0.1901 |
| Fraction of trajectories ever beyond 100 km | 0.2150 |
| Fraction of target detections beyond 100 km | 0.0181 |

## Notes for Stage 07

Stage 07 should evaluate threshold-only detection performance both
overall and, optionally, split by range bin:

- 0-50 km
- 50-100 km
- 100-200 km
- > 200 km

The per-bin split will make the effect of the range-decay SNR model
directly visible: near bins should show high Pd at every threshold,
far bins should collapse toward the Pd floor.
